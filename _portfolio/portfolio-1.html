title: "Bridging the Digital Divide:<br>Where Do We Stand?"
excerpt: During my internship with XRI Global, I applied skills from both the MSHLT program and my experience as a data analyst to contribute to the development of a user-friendly resource for Language Technology models and data for primarily low-resource languages.

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      As an intern with XRI Global, I collaborated with staff and fellow University of Arizona HLT students on a project aimed at supporting low-resource languages by improving their digital presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team inventoried existing datasets and language models from platforms like Hugging Face, GitHub, and Mozilla Common Voice. For some languages where models were not available, we trained new ones using open datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
      My contributions included designing the underlying database schema, identifying data standards, streamlining data collection workflows, and cleaning and standardizing data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting data powers a user-friendly web interface that allows researchers and developers to easily locate and access resources—helping bridge the digital divide for underrepresented languages.

  <h2>Content</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I cleaned and processed large volumes of multilingual text, trained models, and built custom evaluation scripts using tools like Python, spaCy, scikit-learn, and PostgreSQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      I applied knowledge from courses including NLP, Corpus Linguistics, and Machine Learning, and developed a deeper understanding of real-world data challenges, annotation inconsistencies, and pipeline deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This internship also sharpened my programming and problem-solving skills, and gave me practical experience with collaborative version control, agile workflows, and defining scope with stakeholders.

  <h2>Process</h2>

  <details class="card collapsible-section">
    <summary><strong>Requirements Gathering</strong></summary>
    <p>The first step in creating a database for Bridging the Digital, it was necessaary that I went through the 
      requirements gathering process with project managers and my internship colleagues. The requirements gathering process
      serves to determine what metadata will  be most valuable for language researchers, developers, and other potential users
      of the tool.</p>
      <p>This process involved identifying essential fields (e.g., language name, location, number of speakers, tag/label, data or model source, number of speakers, etc) 
      and ensuring the schema could support ASR, TTS, and NMT datasets and existing models.</p>
      
      <p>The results of this process was a balanced schema that provided more technical information with the practical information about the languages included.</p>
    <div class="card-content">
      <h4>Name & Classification</h4>
      <p>
        Pulled each language’s name, family, and sub-family from Glottolog to structure the hierarchy and enable filtering by genetic lineage.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Schema:</strong> language_name, language_family_id, language_subfamily_id, glottocode</p>

      <h4>Location</h4>
      <p>
        Retrieved each language’s geographic centroid using GeoNames and stored it as a PostGIS POINT.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Schema:</strong> geo_center (PostGIS geometry)</p>

      <h4>Global Region</h4>
      <p>Linked each language to a continent or subregion for aggregation and dashboarding.</p>
      <p><strong>Schema:</strong> continent_or_region_id</p>

      <h4>Number of Speakers</h4>
      <p>Estimated speaker populations were collected to help prioritize support efforts.</p>
      <p><strong>Schema:</strong> num_speakers, pop_source</p>

      <h4>Language Codes</h4>
      <p>
        Standardized ISO 639-1, ISO 639-3, and Glottocode identifiers across the dataset.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Schema:</strong> iso_639_1, iso_639_3, glottocode</p>

      <h4>Models & Datasets</h4>
      <p>
        Cataloged available ASR, TTS, and NMT models from Hugging Face, Common Voice, and other sources.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Schema:</strong> nmt_datasets, nmt_pairs_source, asr_source, asr, tts, nmt</p>
