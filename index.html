    <p>I am a Master’s student in Human Language Technology with a foundation in linguistics and professional experience as a data analyst. My passion lies in developing language technologies that make a tangible difference—enhancing how people interact with the world and the internet through improved language access and inclusivity.</div>

  <div class="card">
    <p>My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in French Language and Literature, followed by a second Bachelor’s in Applied Linguistics. These programs deepened my understanding of language structure, acquisition, and variation, and sharpened my focus on the socio-political dimensions of linguistics. I am particularly interested in discourse analysis and the ethical applications of language technology, including machine learning and large language models.</div>

  <div class="card">
    <p>I specialize in:

<ul>
  <li>Data analysis and visualization using Python, R, and SQL</li>
  <li>Natural Language Processing with libraries such as spaCy, NLTK, and scikit-learn</li>
  <li>French language proficiency (13+ years of study)</li>
</ul>
</div>

  <div class="card">
    <p>Currently, I am completing an <a href="https://www.jenniferhaliewicz.com/portfolio/portfolio-1/">internship with XRI Global</a> where I work on increasing access to language models for low-resource languages. I’m drawn to projects at the intersection of language, equity, and technology—whether that involves building fairer NLP systems, visualizing bias in datasets, or enabling multilingual access to digital services.</div>

  <div class="card">
    <p>I thrive on collaborative problem-solving and bring a blend of creativity and precision to every project. After I complete my Master’s, I hope to continue bridging data science and linguistics—whether in industry, research, or the nonprofit sector. If you’re working on something exciting in this space, I’d love to connect and explore how we can advance language technology together.</div>
